## Getting Started

Simply running the code included in this markdown file will produce the visualizations used to reach the conclusions made in this report. These visualizations included in the markdown file were used for analysis, and can be obtained by either running each R code chunk individually, or by knitting the R Markdown file and visually assessing the output plots produced and published on the report.

### Prerequisites

Before running this code, please be sure to install the packages ggplot2 and dyplr. This has been pre-coded for in the Markdown code, and can be done by running the first R code chunk
